# Hytemon

Prototype scaffolding for a Hytale mod that emulates core monster capture and battle mechanics (Pokemon-inspired) while reusing existing in-game animals/monsters.

## What this repo contains
- A lightweight, engine-agnostic design for capture, battle, and trader NPC systems.
- Pseudocode-style TypeScript illustrating how to wire the systems together.
- A step-by-step guide for integrating the mechanics into a Hytale mod project.
